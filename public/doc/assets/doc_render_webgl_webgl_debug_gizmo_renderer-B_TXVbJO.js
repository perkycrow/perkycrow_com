        Renders debug overlays for scene objects in WebGL: bounding boxes,

        to draw colored lines and small circles.

            Gizmo collection is separate from normal rendering. The WebGL
            renderer calls \`collectGizmo(object, opacity)\` for objects that
            have debug gizmos enabled, then \`flush()\` draws them all on top
            of the scene.

            This renderer does not declare any \`handles\` — it is called
            directly by the traversal logic rather than through the registry.
