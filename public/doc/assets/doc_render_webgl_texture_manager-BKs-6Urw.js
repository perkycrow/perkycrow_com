        Manages GPU texture lifecycle with reference counting and deferred
        deletion. Textures move through three states: active (in use), zombie
        (released but kept in VRAM), and deleted.

        When all references to a texture are released, it becomes a zombie
        rather than being deleted immediately. Zombies are resurrected for
        free if the same image is needed again, avoiding costly re-uploads.

            \`acquire(image)\` returns a WebGL texture for an image source,
            creating one if needed or resurrecting a zombie. Each acquire
            increments a reference count.

            \`release(image)\` decrements the count. When it hits zero the
            texture moves to the zombie pool.

            - \`flushStale(maxAge)\` — evicts zombies older than \`maxAge\` (default 15 minutes)

            auto-acquires one. Useful for renderers that just need the texture
            handle without managing ownership.
