            **\`$id\`** - unique identifier. Use when you need a specific module (the player, the boss).

            **\`$name\`** - human-readable name. Defaults to category if not set.

            **\`$category\`** - for type-based lookups. All entities, all UI panels, all audio sources.

            **\`$tags\`** - for dynamic filtering. Hostile enemies, visible objects, selected items.
            Tags live in an [[ObservableSet]], so you can add and remove them at runtime.

            **\`$bind\`** - convenience shortcut. \`$bind: 'player'\` makes \`parent.player\` point to this module.

            **\`$lifecycle\`** - whether the module participates in start/stop.

            **\`$eagerStart\`** - auto-start when created on a running parent (default: true).

            All optional. When you use \`create()\` without specifying them, Perky figures it out:
            \`$category\` from the class name, \`$name\` from category, \`$id\` from name.

            has that callback.

            \`listenTo()\` solves this. It tracks which modules you're listening to, and when
            you're disposed, those listeners are automatically removed.

            into any branch.
